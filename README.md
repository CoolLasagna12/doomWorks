##Numworks is cool, but can it runs doom?

At this day we still can't make Doom run on a calculator. I found out how to play to [Wolfenstein](https://github.com/zenith391/numworks-wolfenstein), but it isn't possible for doom! 😡 So, I thought that even if my knowledge in C++ was shitty, I could give it a try! 😉

## Building

To build the app, you need to have node.js installed and GCC, also you will need the embedded ARM toolchain and the nwlink nodejs package. You might also need other dependencies, In case you need another dependency: please [open an issue](https://github.com/riley0122/numworks_template_cpp/issues/new).

You can build the app by running
`
make build
`.

And you can run it on a calculator connected to your computer with
`
make run
`.
